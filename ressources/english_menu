This little program simulates a 2 player connect 4, either with ncurses, or CSFML !

If you are a tty user, go with ncurses. It's simpler and doesn't use a graphical library.
If you want more detailed things with sprites and prettier things to look at, use CSFML !



Usage :

./connect_4 [flag]


Flags :

-n : starts in ncurses
-c : starts in CSFML
-h / -f : displays the help menu in english / french


Interactions :

'1' to '7' : row to play
'q' : exit the program



If you don't know about connect 4, here are the rules :

The goal is to be the first to align 4 tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Each player takes turns dropping a token into one of the rows in the playing grid.
The token will always occupy the lowest spot on the row played, and can't be changed.
If no one aligns 4 tokens before the board is full, the game ends up with a draw.


Have fun!
